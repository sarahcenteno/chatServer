# chatServer
This project was completed for my Analysis of Computer Communication Networks course. I have a developed a Client/Server application using socket programming. In this Client/Server application, the client will ask a question from the list below and the server will already have a pre-determined answer ready to be sent back to the client. If the question is not on the list, it will answer back, "I do not understand your question. Please re-enter your question." When the client enters "Thank you.", it will stop the program.

The list of questions are:
1. What is your name?
2. What course is this project for?
3. How many programming assignmentsdo we have?
4. Do you think the secondpart is more challenging?
5. How do you know to respond to these questions?
6. Can I ask you a personal question?
7. Can you answer an arbitrary question?
8. Thank you.

# Getting Started
You will need to open two seperate terminals. First, run the server.py on one terminal. Then, run the client.py on the other terminal. On the client.py program, you can now ask a question from the list and you should automatically receive a response. NOTE: You must enter the question with the right punctuation and capitalization.
